This project contains source code for the
[Server as a function with http4k talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsueRJCJuLI).

For simplicity all the code is located in the `src/test` folder:
 - `Main.kt` entry point and frontend/backend/domain code
 - `Tests.kt` frontend/backend/domain tests
 - `GameView.hbs` handlebars template for the frontend
 - `resources` approval files for frontend tests
